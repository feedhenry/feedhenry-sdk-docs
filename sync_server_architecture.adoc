= Sync Server Architecture

This document details the architecture & inner-workings of the Sync Server.
For a general overview of how the Sync Framework works, see the link:sync_overview.adoc[Sync Overview] document.
For any terminology not explained here, see link:sync_terminology.adoc[Sync Terminology].

== Architecture

The inner-workings of the Sync Server architecture are:
* HTTP handlers
* Queues & Processors
* The Sync scheduler.
Each of these components persist any data they need in MongoDB.

=== HTTP Handlers
These handlers are responsible for handling the Sync requests from Sync Clients.

==== Sync HTTP Handler
Creates or updates the Dataset Client to be synced and pushes pending records
and acknowledgements onto their respective queues for processing.

==== Sync Records HTTP Handler
Compares up-to-date data with a clients state. After getting the delta, it will
check for updates than have been processed but not yet synced. The handler will
iterate through all the records in the delta, if any of them are in the pending
queue already or have already been applied, it will remove them from the delta
and return the updated delta to the client.

=== Queues
There are three queues which are used in Sync:

* `fhsync_queue` - Jobs for Datasets to be synced.
* `fhsync_ack_queue` - Jobs for pending changes that should be acknowledged.
* `fhsync_pending_queue` - Jobs for pending changes to be processed.

Messages put onto the queues are consumed and acted upon by processors.

=== Processors
Each queue has a corresponding processor:

* Sync Processor - takes jobs from the `fhsync_queue` and processes them
* Ack Processor - takes acknowledgements from the `fhsync_ack_queue` and removes them from MongoDB.
* Pending Processor - takes pening items from the `fhsync_pending_queue` and applies the changes to the Dataset Backend.

Each worker in a Sync Server will have one instance of each of these processors
allowing for the tasks to be distributed when horizontally scaled.

=== Sync Scheduler
When horizontally scaled, each Sync Worker will attempt to become the Sync
Scheduler at fixed intervals. This is done by trying to obtain a lock which is located in
MongoDB. While a worker is the Sync Scheduler, it will determine
which Datasets need to be synced. It does this by looking at the timestamp
of the last sync and the sync frequency for the Dataset. If a Dataset should
be synced a job is added to `fhsync_queue`.
